Requirement
The organization shallassess the potential
consequences for individuals and societies that can
result from the development or use of AI systems. The
AI system impact assessment shalldetermine the
potential consequences an AI systems deployment and
intended use has on individuals and societies. The
result of the system impact assessment shallbe
documented and be made available to relevant
interested parties where appropriate.
The organization shouldconsider whether an AI
system affects:
the legal position or life opportunities of individuals;
the physical or psychological well-being of
individuals;
universal human rights;
society.
The organization canintegrate the AI system impact
assessment into their risk assessment Clause 6.1.2. Implementation guidance
Topics the organization should consider can include,
but are not limited to:
a circumstances under which an AI system impact
assessment should be performed, can include
1. criticality of the intended purpose and context
in which the AI system is used or any
significant changes to these;
2. complexity of AI technology and the level of

Artificial Intelligence Risk Management
Scope
This document provides guidance on how
organizations that develop, produce, deploy
or use products, systems and services that
utilize artificial intelligence AI can manage
risk specifically related to AI . The guidance
also aims to assist organizations to
integrate risk management into their AI-
related activities and functions. It moreover
describes processes for the effective
implementation and integration of AI risk
management.
The application of these guidance can be
customized to any organization and its
context.Editor: Peter Deussen DE

Neither ISOIEC 23894 nor
ISOIEC 42001 provides any
guidelines on how to do
perform the actual AI system
impact assessment
Objectives for an AI system impact assessment guidance
document include:
 providing organizations with guidance for achieving a
key requirement of AIMS and assist in achieving
responsible development and use of AI systems
 providing organizations with guidance that is necessary
to institute appropriate AI risk management processes

AI system impact assessment
Scope
This document provides guidance for organizations
performing AI system impact assessments for
individuals and societies that can be affected by an AI
system and its foreseeable applications . It includes
considerations for how and when to perform such
assessments and at what stages of the AI system
lifecycle, as well as guidance for AI system impact
assessment documentation.
Additionally, this guidance includes how this AI system
impact assessment process can be integrated into
an organizations AI risk management and AI
management system .
This document is intended for use by organizations
developing, providing, or using AI systems.  This
document is applicable to any organization, regardless
of size, type and nature.Editor: Peter Deussen DE
